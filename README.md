# Console-Chess
### My attempt at creating a chess program that runs on the console

Currently Unfinished and Unplayable  
Shall be Local PvP rather than PvE  
  
### Finished:  
- Initial Generation of Chess Board  
- Rendering of Chessboard  
- Asking The player to select a piece
- Calculating which tiles are dangerous (for king)  
- Calculating where pieces can move  
- Moving Pieces (*sort of*)  

### In Progress:
- Cycling through turns  
- Pinning Pieces
- Putting King in Check
- Checkmate
  
### Possible Future Features:  
- Logging all moves into a log (perhaps writing to txt file and/or displaying onscreen)
- Porting over to use the libtcod library so I could include mouseclicks and fore/background colours
